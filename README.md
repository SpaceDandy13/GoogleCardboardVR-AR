# VR/AR/RPI

## Descrption

This is a project to utilize Google Cardboard to contribute to  https://aframe.io/ and to the source code here.
We will record several videos to introduce RPI and Troy with VR technology. The videos are scheduled to be delivered on Google Cardboard to public according to the Timeline and Milestones below. Besides, we will contribute to open project -- aframe.io. It is optional but encouraged to build our AR software for Prof. Ruiz, which can improve our overall capability of programming and prepared for further development in AR/VR using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, etc.
